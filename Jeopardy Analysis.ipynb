    "Based on the analysis, there is a pattern of questions with a specific keyword that have a greater value on average than others. For example, questions with the word \"Yuma\" in them have, on average, a greater value than questions with the word \"King\" in them. Additional analysis should be performed for other keywords to identify the set of questions that have high value; these keywords can then be used a focal point for devising a strategy to win the game.
